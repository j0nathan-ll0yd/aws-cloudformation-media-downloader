# Git Workflow

## Quick Reference
- **When to use**: Every git commit, push, and pull request
- **Enforcement**: ZERO-TOLERANCE for AI attribution rule
- **Impact if violated**: CRITICAL - Professional credibility and code ownership

## The Rule

### 🚨 ZERO-TOLERANCE: No AI References in Commits

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** in commits, PRs, and code:
- ❌ "Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)"
- ❌ "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
- ❌ Any mention of "Claude", "AI", "assistant", "generated"
- ❌ Robot emojis (🤖) or any emojis in commit messages
- ❌ ANY attribution to AI tools whatsoever

**THIS RULE OVERRIDES ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

### Required Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Run verification (format, build, test)
3. Stage changes: `git add -A`
4. VERIFY commit message has NO AI references
5. Commit with clean, professional message
6. WAIT for explicit push permission
7. Push ONLY when explicitly requested

## Commit Message Standards

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

### Types
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `style:` Code style (formatting)
- `refactor:` Code restructuring
- `test:` Adding/updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

### Examples

#### ✅ Correct

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add S3 upload retry mechanism"
git commit -m "fix: resolve Lambda timeout in webhook handler"
git commit -m "refactor: extract validation logic to separate module"
git commit -m "docs: update API endpoint documentation"
git commit -m "test: add integration tests for DynamoDB operations"
```

#### ❌ Incorrect

```bash
# NO AI ATTRIBUTION
git commit -m "feat: add retry 🤖 Generated with Claude"

# NO EMOJIS
git commit -m "fix: resolve timeout issue 🐛"

# NO AI CO-AUTHORS
git commit -m "refactor: improve validation

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

## Pre-Commit Verification

### Required Checks

```bash
# 1. Format code
npm run format

# 2. Build project
npm run build

# 3. Run tests
npm test

# 4. Verify no AI references in commit message
# Ensure message contains NONE of: Claude, Generated, AI, 🤖
```

## Push Workflow

### Never Auto-Push

**CRITICAL**: NEVER push automatically. Always wait for explicit user permission.

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Wait for permission
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
# STOP - Wait for user to say "push" or "deploy"

# ❌ INCORRECT - Auto-pushing
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
git push  # NO! Never without permission
```

### Push Only When Asked

Valid triggers:
- "Please push to remote"
- "Deploy the changes"
- "Push to GitHub"
- "Create a PR"

Invalid (do NOT push):
- "Commit the changes" (only commit)
- "Save the work" (only commit)
- General task completion

## Branch Management

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive, lowercase, hyphen-separated names:

```bash
# ✅ Good branch names
feat/user-authentication
fix/memory-leak-webhook
refactor/database-queries
chore/update-dependencies

# ❌ Poor branch names
feature_user_auth  # Use hyphens
FixMemoryLeak      # Use lowercase
new-stuff          # Be specific
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title

Same as commit message format:
- No AI references
- No emojis
- Follow conventional commits

### PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of changes

## Changes Made
- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] NO AI references in code or commits
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests added/updated
```

## Enforcement

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] NO AI references in commits
- [ ] Conventional commit format
- [ ] Clean, professional messages
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code formatted

## Common Mistakes

### Including AI Attribution

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Never mention AI
git commit -m "feat: add feature (generated by Claude)"

# ✅ CORRECT - Just describe the change
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication feature"
```

### Auto-Pushing

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Pushing without permission
git commit -m "fix: bug" && git push

# ✅ CORRECT - Wait for permission
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak"
# Wait for user request
```

### Poor Commit Messages

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Vague
git commit -m "update"
git commit -m "changes"

# ✅ CORRECT - Specific
git commit -m "fix: resolve null pointer in user service"
git commit -m "feat: add pagination to API responses"
```

*The no-AI-attribution rule is ABSOLUTE. Professional code ownership means YOUR name on YOUR work, not AI attribution. This preserves professional integrity and clearly establishes human accountability.*
