/**
 * AWS SDK Client Mock Utilities
 *
 * Provides type-safe mocking of AWS SDK v3 clients using aws-sdk-client-mock.
 * These utilities integrate with the vendor wrapper architecture by allowing
 * mock clients to be injected into the client factory.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/m-radzikowski/aws-sdk-client-mock
 * @see https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk-client-mock-vitest
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import {createSQSMock, resetAllAwsMocks} from '#test/helpers/aws-sdk-mock'
 * import {SendMessageCommand} from '@aws-sdk/client-sqs'
 *
 * const sqsMock = createSQSMock()
 *
 * beforeEach(() => {
 *   sqsMock.reset()
 *   sqsMock.on(SendMessageCommand).resolves({MessageId: 'msg-123'})
 * })
 *
 * afterAll(() => {
 *   resetAllAwsMocks()
 * })
 *
 * test('should send message', async () => {
 *   await handler(event, context)
 *   expect(sqsMock).toHaveReceivedCommand(SendMessageCommand)
 * })
 * ```
